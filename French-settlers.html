                <p>French presence in Nova Scotia can be traced as far back as the early 17th
                    century after many unsuccessful attempts to settle in modern day New
                    England. French settlers eventually began to set up settlements throughout
                    modern day Nova Scotia due to the uncontested colonial nature of the area
                    as well as their willingness to cooperate and build relationships with
                    indigenous people of the region. This region became a very popular entry
                    point into North America for generations of French people looking to leave
                    France and find business opportunities and a new life.
                </p>
                <p>However prosperous Nova Scotia was for French people leaving France, it
                    also proved tumultuous and violent at times. This region was largely
                    independent from colonial France, and was mainly governed by its
                    inhabitants, and eventually British colonial forces began to seek control of
                    the region, spawning several expulsions and cleansing of ethnic French
                    people in the region starting in the mid 18th century. This was a major
                    contributing factor of many French settlers of Nova Scotia, or Acadians, to
                    flee to places like Louisiana. Regardless of the multiple periods of British
                    colonial aggression in the region, Nova Scotia still remained a popular
                    stopping point for many people immigrating from France well up into the
                    19th century.</p>

                <p>The usage of the word Acadia or Acadians can be traced to Greek origins
                    from the word Arcadia, meaning a place of refuge. The area known today as
                    Nova Scotia was commonly given the designation of Acadia or Acadie when
                    it began to be settled in the 16th century by the French. This identity,
                    acadians or cadiens, evolved over the next couple of centuries and is
                    commonly applied to people who are descendants of French Settlers of Nova
                    Scotia as well as descendants of French people who settled elsewhere in
                    North America.

                <p>As previously discussed, some of the earliest French settlements in North
                    America were found in the Nova Scotia region, and despite many British
                    colonial campaigns to expel these people, a strong presence endured there
                    and it became an entry point to the continent for many people seeking
                    refuge in the latter half of the 18th century. Whether it was making their way
                    back after a lackluster repatriation into French society, or escaping France
                    from the growing conflicts leading up to and during the French Revolution,
                    Nova Scotia began to be a gateway fro French refugees.
                    From here, it was very common for French travelers to make their way over
                    to the Mississippi River via the Great Lakes or the modern day Midwest
                    region. This was the route that Louis Chachere took to Southern Louisiana.</p>
                <p>Many French people were repatriated back to France during this time from
                    Nova Scotia because of the increased British presence. A great deal of these
                    repatriated citizens couldnâ€™t find their place in their home country and
                    eventually decided to journey back to North America, this taking a more
                    direct route and seeking out Southern Louisiana, which at the time was
                    under Spanish control but not governed as harshly as British Nova Scotia, as
                    it was becoming a more popular destination among French settlers due to
                    the more robust freedoms most settlers enjoyed.</p>
                <p>Lastly, many travelers made stops in St. Domingue, now modern day Haiti,
                    on their way to Southern Louisiana. Southern Louisiana and some
                    surrounding pockets would go on to be identified as Acadiana.</p>
