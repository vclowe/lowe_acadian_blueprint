                <p>By the mid 1780s, France faced a myriad of problems that contributed to unrest and disdain for the
                    monarchy among the general population. The debt accrued from financing France’s involvement in the
                    American Revolutionary War triggering an increase in taxes to the general public, paired with
                    Enlightenment ideals that challenged commoners to question the current power structure of society,
                    would eventually spark a violent overthrow of the monarchy starting in 1789.

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>One of the most significant ways that France financed the war was by
                    borrowing money from noble families, and promising to pay it back with a
                    large amount of interest in the coming years. By the mid 1780s, it was clear
                    that the way Louis XVI was going to pay back the French nobles (plus
                    exorbitant interest) was by putting the financial strain on the lower classes
                    by increasing their taxes. These nobles began to be known as rentiers, or
                    people who are able to live lavishly on debt interest from the government
                    while contributing little to society. Based off of everything we know about
                    Louis Chachere’s potential background in France, it is quite possible that he
                    was a rentier, and may have chose to flee in order to avoid the growing
                    animosity and calls by the general public to punish these people.

                <p>Louis left France in 1789 with his brother and his wife and arrived in Nova
                    Scotia shortly after. There is no record of Louis’s brother from this point on,
                    so he is assumed to have taken a different name and gone elsewhere. From
                    there they would have traveled along the Great Lakes or American Midwest
                    in order to get to the Mississippi River.

                <p>Louis and his wife, Catherine (1764-1825), seemed to have bought property
                    and settled down in Natchez, Mississippi for around a year. Though it is not
                    known exactly when Louis took the surname of Chachere, its first recording
                    can be found in a document from 1790 in which he gives his power of
                    attorney to an acquaintance in Natchez to sell and liquidate all of his
                    property as he saw fit. </p>

                    Chachere family… having moved to Opelousas
                    from Natchez, executed a power of attorney of

                    des Opelousas, Lt. Louis DeVillars. Witness who

                    that while carefully evading detection by French revolutionary sympathizers in North America, Louis
                    and his wife decided to combine their two surnames in order remain incognito to people who might
