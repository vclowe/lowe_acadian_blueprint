        <p class="intro">This is a story about the flight of a French immigrant to America in the late
          18th century and how it can be used to understand the diversity of ancestral origin stories in America. While
          taking place over two-hundred years ago, the story of Louis
          Chachere (1760-1827) is at its core no different that people seeking a new life in the United States free
          from
          religious and political persecution. </p>
        <p class="intro"> His journey to Louisiana from France is just one ancestral case study out
          of
          millions throughout history that illustrates how any particular region in the United States has developed its
          diversity, history and culture.</p>

        <p>The subject of our story, who’s journey will help guide us as an example of
          people of French origin laying down roots in Louisiana, was a man named
          Louis Chachere. Born around 1760 in France, not much is confirmed about
          Louis Chachere before he traveled to Louisiana, but much is speculated.
        </p>
        <p>It is important to note that Louis Chachere’s story, or rather the story of how
          he became Louis Chachere, has largely been documented through oral
          history in addition to very few tangible records because he was fleeing
          Revolutionary France for safety and covering his tracks. Because of this, it is important to take everything
          that is known about him as well as everything that
          is known about the broader history of people leaving France for North
          America, and fill in the gaps to explain how people who undertook this journey helped to create the cultural
          makeup of Southern
          Louisiana.</p>

        <h2>1763-1796</h2>
        <p>Thought to be a ousin to Louis Chachere, Francois de Charette was a notable French General who served in
          the American Revolutionary War as well as was active as a counter revolutionary military leader. He assisted
          in defending Louis XVI during many attempts to kill or capture the royal family in 1792 and was later given
          charge of forces to overthrow the French Republic and reinstitute a monarchy, a feat which was unsuccessful
          and led to his capture and execution in 1796.</p>
